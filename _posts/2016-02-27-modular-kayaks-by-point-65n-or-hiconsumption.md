description: "Kayaks are one of the best ways to explore the open waters, but they aren't exactly the most portable thing in the world. The team at Point 65N have changed all that with their completely modular kayaks. Utilizing the brand's snap tap technology, the kayak is made up of several different pieces that easily attach to one another."
